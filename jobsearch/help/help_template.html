									Education is a requirement. Almost everyone in their lives had finished at least high school, however most companies these days look for college graduates. Regardless of those things, here at Fresh Start every bit of education is important, whether it'd be something as small elementary or high school, users can place almost any type of education that they wish. 

									<ul class="items">
										<li>1. Institute/University/School Name - The official name of the school/institute/university that the applicant has graduated from. </li>
										<li>2. Qualification - Stages of education that ranges from Elementary to Doctorate(Short Vocational Education is also included). When the user selects either Elementary or High School, the Field of Study and Major fields are disregarded, because at these stages students cannot have a specialization.</li>
										<li>3. Field of Study - Refers to the broad field of your education. For example, accounting students belong to the Business field, but it is not described what type of business study that they undertake.</li>
										<li>4. Major - Answers the earlier question on which branch on a field of study does a student take. Filipinos usually call it as 'course', but that in itself is a misconception. Major is the academic program students take, while course refers to the subject a college student takes.</li>
										<li>5. Year Started/Year Ended - The year when a student has started and finished his studies.</li>
									</ul>
									<b>A saved education should look like this:</b>

									Skills are important factors in determining, whether an applicant is accepted for a job or not. Certain companies look for certain skill sets, and those skillsets will most certainly determine, whether you, the applicant could be useful for their company. 

									Here at Fresh Start, placing skills is as simple as it could be. All you need to do is to place the skill name and your proficiency at said skill. However, please take note that these skills must be accurate and correct, as skills are very important for both company and applicants alike.

									In its most pared down sense, a seminar is a meeting in which people can learn about a topic. Seminars typically take place over the course of a few days and involve cooperative discussion, multiple speakers and opportunities to share perspectives and issues related to the topic. Attending a seminar has numerous benefits, including improving communication skills, gaining expert knowledge, networking with others and renewing motivation and confidence.

									<br><br><b>

									<br><br>
									The paragraph above states the importance of seminars, especially for professionals. That is why, we at Fresh Start believe that attended seminars should be shared, not only as a way to increase numbers, but think of it as a way to see how much the applicant has learned and if the applicant is determined to improve his or her self. Enough about that, lets move on to the system.
									<br><br>
									The system allows the applicant to save seminars in the simplest way possible. Fill up the fields, press save, and voila the data is available for everyone to see. The fields to fill up are as follows: Seminar Title, Address, Date Started, Date Ended, Region, City. The fields themselves are self-explanatory and could be found at the certificate given at the end of the seminar, so filling up the fields would be very easy.
