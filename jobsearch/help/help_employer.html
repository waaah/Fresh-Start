								No one could deny the importance of finding a job for a living. We live through the money we earned at our respective jobs. That is why, filling a job post with valid and trustworthy information will not only help applicants, but also help the company's credibiity in the long run. But enough about that, let's get to the system's basics.

								<br><br>
								First and firstmost, all of the <u><b>fields</b></u> are required and must be <u><b>filled up accordingly</b></u>. 
								<br>
								Secondly, each user can only input <b>one specific job name</b>. For example, if there is a posted job with the name 'Looking for Expert Programmers.'. The system will not accept any job names with the same name.
								<br><br>
								Those are the two main rules. Now let's get on with each field.

								<br><br>
								<ul class="items">
									<li>1. Job Name - As stated earlier, the job name is unique and must not be the same with other job names. The minimum number of characters is ten.</li>
									<li>2. Job Details - This will be main backbone of the job post. User will most likely read this before anything else, so handle this field with great care. Express everything there is to express about the job. What is the job about? What do you do in this job? etc... Promoting the company is also a bonus. Just remember one thing: make the details clear and concise.</li>
									<li>3. Min Salary/Max Salary - </li>
									<li>4. Type of Employment - The choices of this field are as follows.</li>
									<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
										<ul>
											<li>Any - Could be intrepreted as any of the choices of below, or other employment types.</li>
											<li>Full Time - A job with a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer.</li>
											<li>Part Time - Form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job.</li>
											<li>Freelance - A type of job with no contract required and could be done at home.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<li>5. Specialization - Broad set of skills required for the job.</li>
									<li>6. Requirements - Specific set of knowledge/specific skills/educational attainment required for the job.</li>
									<li>7. Responsiblities - Set of duties that an applicant must do for the job.</li>
