					<p>No one could deny the importance of finding a job for a living. We live through the money we earned at our respective jobs. That is why, filling a job post with valid and trustworthy information will not only help applicants, but also help the company's credibiity in the long run. But enough about that, let's get to the system's basics.</p>

					<p>
					First and firstmost, all of the <u><b>fields</b></u> are required and must be <u><b>filled up accordingly.</b></u></p> 
					<p>
					Secondly, each user can only input <b>one specific job name</b>. For example, if there is a posted job with the name 'Looking for Expert Programmers.'. The system will not accept any job names with the same name.

						The Company Profle could be divided into two categories. First is the Company Logo and the other is the Company Info. Let's discuss how the Company Logo works.
						<br><br>
						<b>1. Company Logo</b><br>
						First and foremost, the Company Logo is different from the Profile Image. The Profile Image is the picture of the employer himself, while the CL is the logo of the company. By default, the Company Logo is the official Fresh Start Logo.
