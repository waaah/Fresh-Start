						2. Qualification - Stages of education that ranges from Elementary to Doctorate(Short Vocational Education is also included). When the user selects either Elementary or High School, the Field of Study and Major fields are disregarded, because at these stages students cannot have a specialization.
					</p>
					<p>
						3. Field of Study - Refers to the broad field of your education. For example, accounting students belong to the Business field, but it is not described what type of business study that they undertake.
					</p>
					<p>
						4. Major - Answers the earlier question on which branch on a field of study does a student take. Filipinos usually call it as 'course', but that in itself is a misconception. Major is the academic program students take, while course refers to the subject a college student takes.

						5. Year Started/Year Ended - The year when a student has started and finished his studies.

						Skills are important factors in determining, whether an applicant is accepted for a job or not. Certain companies look for certain skill sets, and those skillsets will most certainly determine, whether you, the applicant could be useful for their company. 

						Here at Fresh Start, placing skills is as simple as it could be. All you need to do is to place the skill name and your proficiency at said skill. However, please take note that these skills must be accurate and correct, as skills are very important for both company and applicants alike.

						In its most pared down sense, a seminar is a meeting in which people can learn about a topic. Seminars typically take place over the course of a few days and involve cooperative discussion, multiple speakers and opportunities to share perspectives and issues related to the topic. Attending a seminar has numerous benefits, including improving communication skills, gaining expert knowledge, networking with others and renewing motivation and confidence.

						<br><br><b>
						(Source:http://education.seattlepi.com/benefits-attending-seminars-1929.html)</b>
						<br><br>
						The paragraph above states the importance of seminars, especially for professionals. That is why, we at Fresh Start believe that attended seminars should be shared, not only as a way to increase numbers, but think of it as a way to see how much the applicant has learned and if the applicant is determined to improve his or her self. Enough about that, lets move on to the system.
						<br><br>
						The system allows the applicant to save seminars in the simplest way possible. Fill up the fields, press save, and voila the data is available for everyone to see. The fields to fill up are as follows: Seminar Title, Address, Date Started, Date Ended, Region, City. The fields themselves are self-explanatory and could be found at the certificate given at the end of the seminar, so filling up the fields would be very easy.

					<p>Every aspiring professional should know the importance of having a good resume. First impressions count, and the first impression that a company will have of you, is dependent on your resume. That is why applicants must present an honest and clear resume.

					<p>
						1. Firstly, on the bottom of the applicant profile screen, the user should be able to see a button (Please look at the image "Resume Builder Button" for reference). Click the said button to proceed. 
					</p>
					<p>
						2. Once step one is completed, the resume builder modal should appear on the screen. There are three resumes available in our resume builder. (Please refer to "Resumes of Resume Builder" for more details.)
					</p>
					<p>
						<div class="carousel" data-indicators="true">
					    	<a class="carousel-item" href="#one!"><img src="../images/resume1.png"></a>

					  	</div>

					</p>
					<p>	

						3. Select one of those three resumes using by clicking the 'Select this Resume' button. If the button is clicked, the user will be prompted to save to save the resume as default, however, the minimum requirement of the resume builder is to have at least one skill and education. However, if those requirements are not fulfilled, the user is prompted with an error

					<p>

						4. After choosing your resume, a new page will open which contains your resume, alongside the other data that was input in the system such as Skills, Education, Personal Information, Seminars, and About Yourself.
